# üß† Lesson: Python Classes & Encapsulation


## üöÄ 1. What Is a Class?

Imagine you‚Äôre designing a video game.
You might have many **heroes**, each with a name, money, and items in their backpack.

Instead of writing new code for each hero, Python lets us use a **class** ‚Äî a *blueprint* for making similar objects.

### Analogy:

> A **class** is like a *cookie cutter*.
> An **object** is like the *cookie* made from it.

So if `Hero` is our cookie cutter, then `Jillian` or `Mario` are individual cookies üç™.

## üß© 2. Simple Example: Calculator Class

Let‚Äôs look at this code:

```python
class Calculator():
    def add(x, y):
        print(x + y)
        return x + y

    def add_many(numbers):
        print(sum(numbers))
        return sum(numbers)

    def subtract(numbers):
        return numbers

Calculator.add(5, 6)
```

### üí° What‚Äôs Happening

* `class Calculator()` ‚Äî defines a new *type* of object called **Calculator**.
* Inside are **methods** (functions that belong to a class):
  `add`, `add_many`, and `subtract`.
* `Calculator.add(5, 6)` calls the `add` method.

## üß± 3. Building Your Own Class: Hero

Now we make a **Hero** class that describes a game character.

```python
class Hero:
    def __init__(self, name, money, inventory):
        self.name = name
        self.money = money
        self.inventory = inventory

    def buy(self, item):
        self.inventory.append(item)
        print(self.inventory)
```

### üîç Breaking it down

#### üèóÔ∏è `__init__` Method

This is a *special* function called every time a new Hero is created.
It sets up the hero‚Äôs starting information (name, money, items).

* `self.name` ‚Äî hero‚Äôs name
* `self.money` ‚Äî how much money the hero has
* `self.inventory` ‚Äî what items they carry

#### üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Creating a Hero

```python
Jillian = Hero("Jillian", 150, ["Potion"])
```

* We just made a new **Hero object** named Jillian!
* Jillian starts with **$150** and one **Potion**.

#### üí∞ Buying an Item

```python
Jillian.buy({"title": "Sword", "atk": 34})
print(Jillian.__dict__)
```

When Jillian buys something:

* The item is added to her inventory list.
* The inventory is printed.
* `__dict__` shows all her data stored in a dictionary format.

## üîí 4. Encapsulation: Protecting Data

Encapsulation means **keeping related data and methods inside a single unit (the class)** ‚Äî and **controlling how outside code interacts** with that data.

### Analogy:

> Imagine the Hero‚Äôs backpack is zipped shut üéí.
> Only the Hero knows how to open it properly (using their methods).
> You don‚Äôt just reach in and mess with it directly!

In Python, we can use **naming conventions** to mark variables as ‚Äúprivate‚Äù (for internal use only).

Example:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # double underscore means "private"

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"{self.owner} has ${self.__balance}")
```

This way, no one outside the class should directly do `my_account.__balance = 0`.
They should use the **methods** (`deposit`, `show_balance`) instead.

## üß† 5. Practice Time

### ‚úèÔ∏è Activity 1 ‚Äì Create Your Own Hero

Make your own hero object with a name, starting money, and one item.

Then, use `.buy()` to add another item to your inventory.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Activity 2 ‚Äì Add Encapsulation

Create a class `Pet` that has:

* A **name**
* A **private variable** for happiness level (e.g., `__happiness`)
* A method to **play()** that increases happiness
* A method to **show_status()** that prints how happy the pet is

Example output:

```
Fluffy is playing fetch!
Fluffy‚Äôs happiness is now 10
```

## üí¨ 6. Key Takeaways

| Concept           | Meaning                                       | Example                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Class**         | Blueprint for creating objects                | `class Hero:`                        |
| **Object**        | A specific example from a class               | `Jillian = Hero(...)`                |
| **Method**        | Function inside a class                       | `def buy(self, item)`                |
| **Encapsulation** | Keeping data + methods together and protected | private variables like `__balance`   |
| **self**          | Refers to the *current object*                | `self.name` means ‚Äúthis hero‚Äôs name‚Äù |

## üåü 7. Challenge (Optional)

Modify the Hero class so that:

* It has a **private money variable** (`__money`)
* You must use a method like `.spend(amount)` to reduce money when buying something

Then print out how much money Jillian has left after buying her sword.
